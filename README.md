# 📊 Uncovering Patterns in Indonesia’s Literacy Development Index (IPLM) Using K-Means Clustering

This project explores patterns in **Indonesia’s Literacy Development Index (IPLM)** using **K-Means clustering**.  
The goal is to identify regional groupings based on literacy development indicators and uncover the key factors that drive literacy growth across Indonesia.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Literacy development is more than just reading habits — it reflects **access, engagement, and community participation**.  
By applying data-driven analysis to IPLM data, this project aims to:

- Group Indonesian regions based on literacy development levels using **K-Means Clustering**  
- Analyze the **components contributing** to literacy growth  
- Provide visual insights into **patterns and disparities** among regions

## 🧩 Dataset Description

The dataset represents the **Indeks Pembangunan Literasi Masyarakat (IPLM)** along with its core components:

| No | Feature | Description |
|----|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Indeks Pembangunan Literasi Masyarakat | Main literacy development index |
| 2 | Rasio Ketercukupan Tenaga Perpustakaan | Ratio of adequate library staff |
| 3 | Tingkat Kunjungan Masyarakat per Hari | Daily library visit rate |
| 4 | Perpustakaan yang Dibina Sesuai SNP | Libraries compliant with national standards |
| 5 | Keterlibatan Masyarakat dalam Kegiatan Sosialisasi Perpustakaan | Community participation in library activities |
| 6 | Jumlah Anggota Perpustakaan | Number of registered library members |
| 7 | Pemerataan Layanan Perpustakaan | Distribution of library services |
| 8 | Ketercukupan Koleksi Perpustakaan | Adequacy of library collections |

## ⚙️ Methods and Tools

**Analysis Workflow:**
1. Data preprocessing and normalization  
2. K-Means clustering for literacy index grouping  
3. Visualization of cluster results  
4. Exploration of factor correlations and feature importance

**Tools & Libraries:**
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- The K-Means algorithm identified **three main clusters** representing low, medium, and high literacy development levels.  
- Regions with **better library access and equitable service distribution** tend to have higher literacy development scores.  
- Surprisingly, **daily visit rates** did not always correlate strongly with the literacy index — showing that **literacy growth is multidimensional**, not solely dependent on physical library attendance.

## 📊 Visual Insights

Some of the visualizations produced in this analysis include:

- K-Means clustering scatter plot of IPLM distribution  
- Heatmap of correlations between IPLM components  
- Bar chart of feature importance contributing to literacy development
